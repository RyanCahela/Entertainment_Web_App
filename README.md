# Entertainment_Web_App

This is a project I made using mockups from [frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/entertainment-web-app-J-UhgAW1X).

I also created the backend api server that this app pulls the images and JSON data. You can view the source code for the server [here](https://github.com/RyanCahela/Entertainment_Web_App_Backend).

Even though it's not pulling that much data I wanted to get more experience in handleing loading states and learn more about streaming data from the server.
